This course introduces the process of building web-based applications in Node.js with Express. Students learn to create web forms, collect and process information obtained from them, retrieve and update information contained in a MongoDB database, and build stand-alone RESTFul API’s. GitHub is used to host and share coding projects.

Chapter 1 – What is Express:
Express is a relatively small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server functionality
to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize
your application’s functionality with middleware and routing; it adds helpful
utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects; it facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTML views;
it defines an easily implemented extensibility standard.

Chapter 2 – The basics of Node.js

There are a number of ways to install Node. I recommend using a version manager
so that you can easily change versions and upgrade as needed.
1-  Node’s module system makes use of a global function called require and a
global object called module.exports. The two make for a straightforward module
system.
2-  You can use npm to install third-party packages from the npm registry.
3-  Node.js has evented I/O. This means that when an event happens (such as an
incoming web request), a function (or set of functions) is called.
4-  Node has a built-in module called http. It is useful for building web applications.
